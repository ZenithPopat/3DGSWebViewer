# Garden Model:
This particular garden model is a pretrained model from [Inria 3DGS](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/) and rotated to fit our editor. The garden data set originates from [Mip-NeRF 360: Unbounded Anti-Aliased Neural Radiance Fields](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9878829).

All other models are captured my Markus Schütz, reconstructed with Jawset Postshot, and cleaned with Splatshop.
